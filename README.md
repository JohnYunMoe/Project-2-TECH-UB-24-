# Major URL Generator

This Python project allows users to generate a URL for the course listings page of their chosen major at NYU Abu Dhabi. The user inputs their major, and the script formats the input to fit the URL structure used by the NYUAD website. The `requests` library is used to send an HTTP GET request to fetch the corresponding course listings page for that major. After making the request, the program makes a checklist of all the required courses for the students major to graduate. Then checklist is interactive and can be used by the student to check how many courses they have left to take to graduate. The URL is generated by replacing spaces in the major with hyphens and converting the major name to lowercase, ensuring it matches the correct format for the NYUAD websiteâ€™s course listings pages.
